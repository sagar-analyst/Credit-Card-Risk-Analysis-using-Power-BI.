# 💳 Credit Card Risk Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed **during my data analytics training** to analyze a credit card portfolio of 10K+ customers and assess portfolio-level risk.

The objective was to identify high-risk customer segments, quantify exposure at risk, and understand utilization-driven risk patterns.  
The project was **recently refined and uploaded to GitHub** to showcase applied risk analytics and decision-focused dashboarding using Power BI.

A multi-page Power BI dashboard was designed to provide executive-level visibility and segment-level insights.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Credit card portfolios often face **concentration risk**, where a small proportion of customers contributes a large share of potential loss.

Without structured visibility into risk drivers, credit teams struggle to:
- Identify vulnerable customer segments  
- Quantify exposure at risk  
- Take timely, targeted risk mitigation actions  

This project focuses on enabling **segment-driven credit risk decisions** instead of uniform policies.

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked
- Total Customers  
- Revenue  
- Exposure at Risk  
- High-Risk Customer Percentage  
- Credit Utilization (%)  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- A relatively small group of customers contributes a disproportionate share of portfolio exposure at risk.  
- High-risk customers exhibit significantly higher credit utilization compared to low-risk segments, indicating elevated default risk.  
- Certain card tiers and income segments drive higher relative risk, highlighting the need for differentiated credit controls.

## 📁 Dashboard Pages
- **Executive Overview** – Portfolio health, revenue, and exposure at risk  
- **Credit Risk Drivers** – Utilization and exposure analysis by card category and risk band  
- **Customer Risk Segmentation** – Risk distribution across age and income segments  
- **Insights & Actions** – Summary of findings with actionable credit risk recommendations

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI  
- DAX (Measures and Calculated Columns)  
- Data Modeling  
- Risk Segmentation  
- Data Visualization & Storytelling

## 📁 Power BI Report File (Template)

Due to Power BI tenant restrictions, the report cannot be published publicly as a live dashboard.

A **Power BI template file (`.pbit`)** is provided instead, which includes:
- Complete data model and relationships  
- DAX measures and calculated columns  
- Report visuals, layout, and navigation  

### How to view the report:
1. Download the `.pbit` file from this repository  
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**  
3. Connect to a compatible dataset or sample data when prompted  

This approach allows reviewers to fully explore the report structure and analytical logic without exposing underlying data.

## 📌 Outcome
This project, completed during training and later refined for portfolio presentation, demonstrates how credit risk analytics and Power BI dashboards can support **data-driven risk monitoring and decision-making**.

The analysis highlights utilization stress, exposure concentration, and high-risk customer segments, enabling more targeted and effective credit risk strategies.
